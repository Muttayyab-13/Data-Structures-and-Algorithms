Java Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)
This repository contains a collection of Java implementations and explanations of fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts. It's designed to help students, programmers, and interview candidates strengthen their understanding and problem-solving skills in DSA.

Contents
Data Structures: Implementations and explanations of commonly used data structures, including:

Arrays
Linked Lists
Stacks
Queues
Trees (Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree, etc.)
Graphs (Adjacency List, Adjacency Matrix)
Algorithms: Implementations of key algorithms with explanations and examples:

Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
Searching Algorithms (Binary Search, Linear Search)
Graph Algorithms (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra's, Prim's, Kruskal's)
Practice Problems: A set of coding problems and exercises to reinforce each concept, with solutions provided for reference.

Interview Prep: Frequently asked DSA interview questions and sample answers, covering popular topics and problem-solving techniques.
